# eulerInMatlab
Euler's path/Circuit algorithm implemented in Matlab

This algorithm is implemented in MATLAB t0 hack the android game "One Touch Play Master". That is, to build an automatic game solver using 
Matlab ADB tool, Euler's path and a bit of Image processing.

The input is given in Graph Matrix.
